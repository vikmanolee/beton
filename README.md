## A simple Sportsbook app.

  * Create Outrights, Markets and Selections
  * Manage your odds as a trader
  * Accept bets
  * Set results and settle your bets

## To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

**Or**, with to deploy with docker:
  * Build and start with `docker-compose up`
  * Re-build with `docker-compose build`
  * Stop with `docker-compose down`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
